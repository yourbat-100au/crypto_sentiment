## 📌 Objective

To develop optimized cryptocurrency trading strategies using Twitter sentiment analysis, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Time Series modeling within the MATLAB environment.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Retrieve Twitter data for cryptocurrency sentiment.
- Classify sentiments using ML models and compare with VADER and rule-based methods.
- Use sentiment data as external variables in time series forecasting.
- Design, backtest, and evaluate trading strategies informed by sentiment signals.
- Optimize a crypto-cash portfolio under various risk levels.

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Use MATLAB’s Twitter API connection to collect tweets with crypto-related hashtags.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Clean and tokenize text.
   - Train ML classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
   - Compare with VADER and Ratio Rule sentiment scores.
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extract tweet volume, average sentiment score, and tweet volatility.
   - Integrate Large Language Model via MATLAB API (optional).
4. **Time Series Modeling**
   - Build ARIMA and LSTM models using sentiment as a regressor.
   - Evaluate with RMSE, MAPE, and other metrics.
5. **Trading Strategy & Backtesting**
   - Design strategy using sentiment-informed signals.
   - Optimize portfolio using Financial Toolbox.
   - Backtest using historical price data and evaluate performance.
